# Architecture

Data flows one way through the writer: read, plan, stream and fold, write, publish. No
stage reaches back into an earlier one.

## Input adapter

`protocols.py` declares `ContinuousChannelSource` and `UnitChannelSource`. Each exposes
one channel's metadata and windowed reads (`read_samples`, `read_events`, and the rest).

`nwb_reader.py` is the only concrete adapter. Everything downstream depends on the
protocols, not on NWB. The core is testable against in-memory sources, and a second input
format costs one new adapter and no changes elsewhere.

`nwb_reader.py` also normalizes samples to microvolts, so every channel reaching the
writer is already in the unit the bundle promises.

## Decision layer

`planning.py` and `sizing.py` are pure functions with no I/O. `planning.py` decides how
many levels a channel gets and each level's shape and `period_us`. `sizing.py` decides
the inner chunk and outer shard shapes for one array.

Keeping these separate from the write path means the format's arithmetic is unit-testable
without touching a store.

## Numeric core

`fold.py` reduces one level to the next: min and max over disjoint blocks of 4. See
[the format spec](./bundle-format.md) for the exact rule and the NaN behavior.

`streaming.py` drives the fold over a source one block at a time and buffers across block
boundaries so a run of 4 that straddles two blocks still folds correctly. Memory stays
bounded no matter how long the recording is.

## Write path

`write_continuous.py` and `write_unit.py` each write one channel by composing the stages
above. They hold the per-channel logic and no Zarr specifics.

Both pick their read block so that every write covers a whole shard. A narrower write
makes the sharding codec read the shard back, re-encode every inner chunk, and rewrite
it, which costs about 10x the store traffic on a 16-chunk shard.

`zarr_io.py` is the only module that imports `zarr`. Everything else is Zarr-agnostic, so
the Zarr v3 API surface this package depends on sits in one file.

`attrs.py` builds the attribute dicts, the format's only custom surface.

## Orchestration

`bundle.py` runs the whole job: assign channel indices, write each channel, consolidate
metadata, publish atomically.

`main.py` and `config.py` are the CLI and environment-config shell around it.
`config.py` resolves both invocation forms, positional arguments and the
`INPUT_DIR`/`OUTPUT_DIR` convention.
